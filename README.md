# Campsite-Cost-Calculator_Pet-Project

This project is created to calculate the cost of the duration of camping in advance based on the information given by users.

By using user interface, providing the number of campers and the lenght of duration will calculate your cost consedering one more factor which is firewood.

System gives $6 value for each firewood bag, so it will be considered one of the expenses as well.

System provides the most afforable result.

There are 3 sizes; small, regular, and large respectively.

Each campsite has different capacity, cost, and needed firewood bag.

Here is the link to try it out:
