# Campsite-Cost-Calculator_Pet-Project

## This project was intended to estimate the cost of camping for a specific period of time based on information provided by users.

**By using the user interface and entering the number of campers and the length of stay, your cost will be calculated, taking into account one more factor: firewood.**

- Each firewood bag has a $6 value in the system, thus it will be counted as an expense.

- The system produces the most cost-effective outcome.

- Small, regular, and large are the three sizes available.

- Each campsite has a varied capacity, price, and firewood bag requirement.

## Here's where you can try it out: https://phenomenal-kitten-e124c4.netlify.app/
