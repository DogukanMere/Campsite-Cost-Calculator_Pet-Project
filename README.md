# Campsite-Cost-Calculator_Pet-Project

//This project was intended to estimate the cost of camping for a specific period of time based on information provided by users.

By using the user interface and entering the number of campers and the length of stay, your cost will be calculated, taking into account one more factor: firewood.

Each firewood bag has a $6 value in the system, thus it will be counted as an expense.

The system produces the most cost-effective outcome.

Small, regular, and large are the three sizes available.

Each campsite has a varied capacity, price, and firewood bag requirement.
